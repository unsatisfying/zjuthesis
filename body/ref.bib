abstract = {Software ecosystems play an important role in modern software development, providing an open platform of reusable packages that speed up and facilitate development tasks. However, this level of code reusability supported by software ecosystems also makes the discovery of security vulnerabilities much more difficult, as software systems depend on an increasingly high number of packages. Recently, security vulnerabilities in the npm ecosystem, the ecosystem of Node.js packages, have been studied in the literature. As different software ecosystems embody different programming languages and particularities, we argue that it is also important to study other popular programming languages to build stronger empirical evidence about vulnerabilities in software ecosystems. In this paper, we present an empirical study of 1,396 vulnerability reports affecting 698 Python packages in the Python ecosystem (PyPi). In particular, we study the propagation and life span of security vulnerabilities, accounting for how long they take to be discovered and fixed. In addition, vulnerabilities in packages may affect software projects that depend on them (dependent projects), making them vulnerable too. We study a set of 2,224 GitHub Python projects, to better understand the prevalence of vulnerabilities in their dependencies and how fast it takes to update them. Our findings show that the discovered vulnerabilities in Python packages are increasing over time, and they take more than 3 years to be discovered. A large portion of these vulnerabilities (40.86\%) are only fixed after being publicly announced, giving ample time for attackers exploitation. Moreover, we find that more than half of the dependent projects rely on at least one vulnerable package, taking a considerably long time (7 months) to update to a non-vulnerable version. We find similarities in some characteristics of vulnerabilities in PyPi and npm and divergences that can be attributed to specific PyPi policies. By leveraging our findings, we provide a series of implications that can help the security of software ecosystems by improving the process of discovering, fixing and managing package vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are now presenting human-level performance on many real-world applications, and DNN-based intelligent services are becoming more and more popular across all aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing DNN service implies a dangerous feature which has not yet been well studied–allowing the marriage of existing malware and DNN model for any pre-defined malicious purpose. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate how to turn DNN into a new breed evasive self-contained stegomalware, namely StegoNet, using model parameter as a novel payload injection channel, with no service quality degradation (i.e. accuracy) and the triggering event connected to the physical world by specified DNN inputs. A series of payload injection techniques which take advantage of a variety of unique neural network natures like complex structure, high error resilience capability and huge parameter size, are developed for both uncompressed models (with model redundancy) and deeply compressed models tailored for resource-limited devices (no model redundancy), including LSB substitution, resilience training, value mapping, and sign-mapping. We also proposed a set of triggering techniques like logits trigger, rank trigger and fine-tuned rank trigger to trigger StegoNet by specific physical events under realistic environment variations. We implement the StegoNet prototype on Nvidia Jetson TX2 testbed. Extensive experimental results and discussions on the evasiveness, integrity of proposed payload injection techniques, and the reliability and sensitivity of the triggering techniques, well demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of StegoNet.},

abstract = {The rising popularity of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made them an attractive target for attackers looking to steal Intellectual Property (IP) such as ML models or disrupt the operation of heterogeneous computing systems. However, defending against GPU attacks is anything but trivial since the inner workings of these-often proprietary-devices are still poorly understood. Preliminary work demonstrates a worrying similarity to the attack surface of the CPU domain, particularly concerning the memory unsafety of device-side code. We corroborate these worrying findings by constructing the first rigorous experimental analysis of input-triggered, ROP-based exploits entirely within device-side NVIDIA CUDA code. We repurposed known CPU-based code-reuse attack techniques to unlock previously unusable gadgets in this code and demonstrate that the gadget set is Turing-complete, enabling attackers to perform arbitrary computations. We conclude that ROP attacks on GPUs are feasible and more potent than previously thought.Following this discovery, we evaluate the strength of current device-side mitigations, such as stack canaries and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Given the lack of more powerful protection mechanisms, these basic security measures play a crucial role in GPU security. However, we find them even less secure than their CPU counterparts. Our findings indicate that the GPU domain urgently needs robust protection mechanisms that fit the unique GPU architectures and address the flaws in existing systems.},
